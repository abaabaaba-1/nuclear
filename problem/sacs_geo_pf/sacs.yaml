# sacs.yaml (V3 - Syntactically Safe Version)
description: |
  You are an expert SACS optimization bot. Your mission is to find a diverse set of optimal jacket structures by modifying their geometry to explore the trade-offs between weight and stress (UC values). Think like an architect to propose conceptually different designs.

# --- Objective Definitions ---
weight: 'Total structural weight in tonnes. Lower is better.'
axial_uc_max: 'Maximum axial stress ratio. Goal is to minimize. Must be <= 1.0.'
bending_uc_max: 'Maximum bending stress ratio. Goal is to minimize. Must be <= 1.0.'


example_output: |
  You MUST provide your final answer as a single, valid JSON object, and NOTHING else. Enclose the entire JSON object within `<candidate>` and `</candidate>` tags. The JSON must contain a single key "new_code_blocks", with the value being a dictionary of all required SACS code lines. The `GRUP` and `PGRUP` lines must be included but should remain unchanged from the parent.
  
  Example of a valid output:
  <candidate>
  {
      "new_code_blocks": {
          "GRUP_DUM": "GRUP DUM         12.000 1.000 29.0011.6036.00 9    1.001.00     0.500N490.00",

# --- Genetic Operation Instructions ---
mutation_instruction: |
  INSTRUCTION: Perform a CONCEPTUAL MUTATION.

  1. Analyze the parent's performance (weight, axial_uc_max, bending_uc_max).
  
  2. Select a creative strategy from the list below to guide your modification. Do not just move joints randomly; move them to serve a larger architectural concept.
     - Strategy A: "V-Shape Profile". Make the jacket's legs form a more pronounced V or A shape. A wider base can increase stability (lower UC), while a narrower top can save weight.
     - Strategy B: "X-Bracing Angles". Adjust joint locations to make cross-bracing angles more or less acute. Angles around 45 degrees are often efficient.
     - Strategy C: "Tiered Setbacks". Make one elevation (e.g., the 400-level joints) significantly narrower or wider than the levels above or below it.
     - Strategy D: "Targeted Fix". If the parent has a specific weakness (e.g., high bending_uc_max), propose a targeted geometric change to fix it. For example: "Parent has high bending stress. I will adjust joints 401 and 403 to improve the bracing angle at that level."

  3. Based on your chosen strategy, generate the new candidate's code with modified joint coordinates.

crossover_instruction: |
  INSTRUCTION: Perform a THEMATIC CROSSOVER.

  1. Analyze both parents. Identify the best conceptual feature of each. For example, "Parent A has a very wide and stable base (good V-Shape), while Parent B has a very efficient and lightweight top section."
  
  2. Create a child that hybridizes these concepts. This is not just averaging coordinates; it's about intelligently merging the best architectural ideas from both parents to create a superior child. For instance, combine the wide base coordinates from Parent A with the narrow top section coordinates from Parent B.
  
  3. Do not modify any GRUP or PGRUP blocks.

# --- Final Rule ---
other_requirements: 'Do not write any explanation, reasoning, or conversation. Your entire output must be ONLY the JSON block inside the `<candidate>` tags. Maintain the fixed-width format perfectly.'
